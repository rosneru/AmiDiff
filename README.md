This is me learning the basics of AMIGA programming.

Maybe someday this develops into a graphical diff tool for OS2.04 and 
above.

After cloning this repository the needed submodules should be initialized:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update


### Development environment ###

* Amiga with OS3.9
* NDK for AmigaOS 3.9
* StormC 4
