This is me on my Amiga experimenting and learning the basics of
ReAction programming.

Maybe someday this developes into a graphical diff tool for OS2.X and 
OS 3.x Amigas which could be ported to OS4.x without too many efforts.


### Development environment ###

* Amiga with OS3.9
* NDK 3.9
* StormC 4
