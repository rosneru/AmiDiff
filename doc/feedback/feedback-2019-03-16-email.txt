Thanks for the update!

But a few issues remain

1. Comparing the included files gives a somewhat odd result, one string 
changed, but we get a full block of changes

2. Compare two files, open the file requester to compare something 
again and select the same file in both path result should be no diff, 
but we are greeted with a lot of changes in the same file!

3. And forgot to add, after comparing an option to invert comparison 
would be nice that is first and second file exchanged, so that deleted /
added strings change if files were not in correct order new/old

4. Amiga-conform version string
